        The length of a curling rink is 45,720 meters (150 feet), and its width can be a maximum of 5 meters (16 feet and 5 inches). <br> The outer ring's radius of the two houses at the ends is 1,829 m/1,219 m and the inner ring's radius is 0,610 m/0,152 m. <br> The inner ring is called the tee and the center is called the button. <br> The center of the house is 4.88 meters from the end of the rink, and the footer, from where the player starts sliding, is 1.22 meters from the end. <br> Across the rink, there are three lines: <br> the tee line goes through the center of the circle, the back-line is the rink's edge at the end facing the house and the third one is the hog-line, the line where the sliding player has to release the stone.

            The origin of the game is not clear. Although it is considered a national sport in Scotland, it is more likely that Holland is the game's homeland. <br> A game that was not played according to today's rules was already being played in the Low Countries more than 450 years ago. <br> The game can also be seen in a painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. <br> The first written mention of the game comes from Scotland in 1540, written by John McQuhin, a clerk from Paisley. <br>
            The first official curling club was founded in Edinburgh in 1838. <br> Its original name was the Grand Caledonian Curling Club, but it was changed to the Royal Caledonian Curling Club in 1843, and it eventually became the sport's international governing body. <br> The sport was introduced to Canada in 1807, where it quickly gained immense popularity and a club was established that same year. <br> The United States' first curling club was founded in Michigan in 1832. <br> The first international match was also played between teams from these two countries in 1884. <br> The game quickly spread to Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, and New Zealand. <br> The sport's first rulebook was created at the Grand Caledonian Curling Club.

        <h2>Match</h2>
        <img src="curling.jpg" class="jobbra_igazit" height="300px">
        <p class="bal">
        A match consists of ten ends. <br> Each team has 38 minutes of thinking time per end, which means their time starts when they start preparing for their throw and ends when the opposing team's stone stops moving. <br> When the stone is in motion, time stops. (Previously, each team had "gross" 73 minutes of thinking time, but this has been modified) <br> In the case of a tie, an extra end is played, where each team has an additional 4.5 minutes of thinking time. <br> Both teams have two, 60-second time-out opportunities in a 10-end match. <br> If one team leads by a significant margin, they may offer to shake hands early and the match will not last ten ends, but at least six ends must be played regardless of the outcome. <br>
        An end consists of 8-8 stone throws. <br> The winner of the end is the team whose stone(s) is closest to the center of the target area at the end of the end. <br> The team earns as many points as there are stones closer to the center than the opposing team's closest stone. <br> At the end of each end, the teams switch sides, which is practical because the stones do not have to be "moved back" to the starting position every time.
